# jetibox_micro
This is a project to recreate a JetiBox (small Box with display to display sensor data or sensor/device menus from Jeti remote control devices). This project specifically aimed for using a very small display to be able to fit it into a Graupner MC24 instead of the voltmeter/battery meter.
